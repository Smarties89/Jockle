Jockle
======

A Mockup of a HTTP API for fast prototyping

Remark still *super-alpha mode*. It is built as a *need-to-have* tool, and is not *finished, polished or looking good.*



Plan to implement
=================

* Make Jockle server act as proxy for another server. This makes it possible to develop with Jockle, and switch of API's as soon as they are implemented.
* Better handling of URL containing "regex"(more like a subset of regex).
* Make it possible to insert input variables.
* Make a server-stub-maker for Flask.
* Make a client-stub-maker for Python-Requests.
