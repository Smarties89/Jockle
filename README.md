Jockle
======

A Mockup of a HTTP API for fast prototyping

Remark still *super-alpha mode*. It is built as a *need-to-have* tool, and is not *finished, polished or looking good.*



Plan to implement
=================


* Better url syntax. Right now it uses regular expression, and it would be easier to use a form of Flask syntax(e.g. /api/databases/<did>/...)
* Jockle server act as proxy for another server. This makes it possible to develop with Jockle, and switch of API's as soon as they are implemented. In a sense use two webservers.
