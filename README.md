Jockle
======

A Mockup of a HTTP API for fast prototyping

Remark still *super-alpha mode*. It is built as a *need-to-have* tool, and is not *finished, polished or looking good.*

Features
========

* Easy prototype webservices, for other webservices or home pages.
* Proxy to another service(so you can use all the existing service, but add new ones)
* Full HTTP Codes


Plan to implement
=================

* Handling for Flask regular expressions.
* Make it possible to insert input variables.
* Make a server-stub-maker for Flask.
* Make a client-stub-maker for Python-Requests.
